<h1>About Me!</h1>
<img align="center" src="images/riyana.jpg" height="250" />
<p>My name is Riyana Chawla and I am 17 years old.</p>
<p>Some of my interests and hobbies include: playing in marching band, reading, travelling, and activism. I am the co-founder of my school's Amnesty International club and am also involved in climate activism as well.</p>
<p>My goals for the school year are: maintaining a good GPA, applying and getting admitted to college, becoming more involved in school events such as sports games, and to hopefully figure out what I want to study in college.</p>
<p>I love Beyonce, Khalid, H.E.R, and a lot of other R&B artists! My favorite TV shows are: Stranger Things, The Office, New Girl, and more.</p>
